# Textâ€‘toâ€‘Speech Frontâ€‘End

This frontâ€‘end provides a simple, responsive user interface for interacting with the **Textâ€‘toâ€‘Speech API Service**.  It is intended as a companion to the backâ€‘end API defined in the `tts-api-service` directory of this repository.  With this UI you can register a new account, authenticate, browse available voices and synthesize your own audio recordings.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Registration & Login**: Create a new user account or sign in with existing credentials.  JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are stored in `localStorage` for subsequent requests.
- **Voice Selection**: Retrieve the full list of supported languages and voices from the `/api/tts/voices` endpoint and choose your preferred combination.
- **Customizable Synthesis**: Configure audio encoding (MP3, WAV, OGG), speaking rate, pitch and volume.  You can also opt for asynchronous or streaming synthesis.
- **Audio Preview & Download**: For synchronous synthesis requests, the generated audio is played directly in the browser and offered as a downloadable file.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and devices without relying on external CSS frameworks.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Ensure the API service is running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.  You may modify the `API_BASE_URL` constant in `script.js` if your backâ€‘end runs on a different host or port.
2. Serve the contents of the `tts-frontend` directory with any static file server.  For example, using Python:

   ```bash
   cd tts-frontend
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

   Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

3. Register a new user, log in, and start synthesizing!

## ðŸ§© Structure

- **`index.html`** â€“ Defines the markup for login/registration and synthesis forms.
- **`style.css`** â€“ Contains modern, lightweight CSS to style the interface.  No thirdâ€‘party frameworks required.
- **`script.js`** â€“ Implements the client logic: authentication flow, voice loading, synthesis requests and UI state management.
- **`README.md`** â€“ This documentation file.

Feel free to extend this frontâ€‘end with additional features such as displaying synthesis history, monitoring asynchronous job status, or improving styling.  The code is intentionally kept straightforward to make customization easy.
